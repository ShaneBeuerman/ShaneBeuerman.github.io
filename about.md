I graduated from Montana State University in 2016 and I am currently looking for opportunities in the field of computer science.  I have many diverse skills that I amassed over the course of those four years and I am willing to learn more.

I knew very little about programming in general before I took my first Java course.  However, I worked hard to learn even when I was behind some of the other students.  I spent hours testing and working through problems I wasn't well-handled to deal with efficiently.  Nonetheless, I continued to work hard to catch up with students well-versed in the subject.  Many students and teachers helped me grow my programming skills, and I made sure to do the same to those who needed help as well.

I spent many hours in the computer lab working with other students for group projects.  I have experience working from day to night, toiling away to get an assignment completed with people I may have never met otherwise.
