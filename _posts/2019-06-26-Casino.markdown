There are four games that you can play and bet in this program. There is blackjack, roulette, craps, and poker. It is entirely text-based and asks the player which game they want to play. Each game asks the player how much they want to bet. Roulette asks what kind of bet you want to make and pays out depending on the bet made. You can bet an odd bet, even bet, bet on red, bet on black, column bets, dozen bets, bets from 1-18, bets from 19-36, and a single bet. By playing craps, you can make a passline bet, a don't pass bet, a field bet, an eleven roll bet, a three roll bet, snake eyes bet, twelve roll bet, hi-lo bet, craps roll, or a seven roll bet. Pay outs for all bets depend on the bet chosen. Poker creates a deck of 52 cards and randomly shuffles them. Then, it deals you five cards and the dealer five cards. If your hand is better than the dealers hand, then your bet doubles. If the dealer hand is the same as yours, it is a push. If the dealer's hand is better than yours, you lose. Blackjack deals you two cards from a randomly shuffled deck. You can see one of the dealer's cards face up, but not the other one. You can decide to hit or stay. If you bust, then you lose. If you stay, the dealer then proceeds with his turn. If the dealer's hand is better than yours, you win. If the dealer busts you win.
