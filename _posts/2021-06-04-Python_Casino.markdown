A variety of different of casino games that you can play. There is currently keno and a slotmachine. The card games have not been completed yet.

Keno requires the player to make a bet and then choose eight numbers. This version of Keno only has the option of choosing eight numbers. You select eight unique numbers between 1 and 80. Then, twenty unique numbers from 1 to 80 are chosen. If you match any of those numbers with your selected numbers, you win money.

The slotmachine works like a normal slotmachine would. There are 6 values on the slot machine reels. If you get a 0 on any of the three reels, then you get your money back. If you match two of the same symbol on your slot machine, then you get twice your money back. If you match all three of the same symbol, you win 3x up to 7x your wager back. You can also wager in increments of 5, 10, 50 or 100 dollars.
