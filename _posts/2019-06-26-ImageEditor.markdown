[ImageEditor](https://github.com/ShaneBeuerman/ImageEditor)

Image Editor takes in an image as a command line argument and asks the user how the want to edit it. When it is running, it prompts the user to select how they want the image to be edited. If you select invert, all the colors of the image are inverted. If you select make green, the green value is maxed out at 255. If you select make blue, the blue value is maxed out at 255. If you select make red, the red value is maxed out at 255. If you select make cyan, the blue and green values are maxed out at 255. If you select make yellow, the red and green values are maxed out at 255. If you select make magenta, the red and blue values are maxed out at 255. When you make your selection, the program saves the output as output.jpg and opens up a window of what the edited image looks like.
